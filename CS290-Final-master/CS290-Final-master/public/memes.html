                    It broke out of its shell like a flocking boss and double punched its mother in the gut. After delivering the deadly double punch to his feather-mother; our hero named himself
                    "Marty McFly" and busted out of his nest. He eventually flew into a flock of bird thugs, named; The Ruffed Feathers ft. Hillary Puff. They
                    tried to beat him up and pluck his feathers but McFly knew better. He ducked; he dodged, and he flapped furiously until each member of
                     the Ruffed Feathers ft. Hillary Puff were donezo. Story to be continued.</p>
