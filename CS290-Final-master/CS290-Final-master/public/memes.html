            <p> <img src="birp.jpg" style="width:300px;height:300px;"> This is the story of the berd that really did the thing. One day the bird was born.
            It broke out of its shell like a flocking boss and double punched its mother in the gut. After delivering the deadly double punch to his feather-mother; our hero named himself
            "Marty McFly" and busted out of his nest. He eventually flew into a flock of bird thugs, named; The Ruffed Feathers ft. Hillary Puff. They
            tried to beat him up and pluck his feathers but McFly knew better. He ducked; he dodged, and he flapped furiously until each member of
             the Ruffed Feathers ft. Hillary Puff were donezo. Story to be continued.</p>
