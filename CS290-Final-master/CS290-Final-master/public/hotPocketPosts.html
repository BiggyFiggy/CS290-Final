		<h2> A hot pocket made me cry.</h2>
		<p> The other night, I was starving, and had very little food. Thankfully, my roommate let me have one of her hot pockets
		to snack on. I gleefully heated up the heavenly treat and rushed back to my room to devour it. Since I was super starving,
		I didn't give it enough time to cool down, and the lava within poured into my mouth. I needed food in my stomach, so I 
		powered through it with teary eyes.</p>
